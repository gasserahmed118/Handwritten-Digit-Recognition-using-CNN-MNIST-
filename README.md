📋 Overview:

This project builds and trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a benchmark dataset of 70,000 grayscale images, each sized 28×28 pixels, widely used to evaluate image classification algorithms. The goal of this project is to design a simple yet powerful deep learning model that can accurately recognize digits, achieving high accuracy with efficient training.

✨ Key Features:
End-to-end deep learning pipeline : Includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.
CNN architecture : Uses Convolution, MaxPooling, Flatten, and Dense layers to learn spatial features from images.
High accuracy performance : CNNs typically achieve >99% accuracy on MNIST.
Visualization tools: Training accuracy/loss curves , Predictions on test images , Confusion matrix 
Compatible with modern TensorFlow / Keras
